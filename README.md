### OSes supported:

- Arch based Linux (normal script)
- Other (Pengoo script, will not be updated...)
(Logos)


### Known issues:
- No support for BSD package managers/uptime calculations.
- Completely breaks on Android due to the fact that /etc/os_release doesn't exist on Android
- Weird spacing on macOS if you use brew given its complete weirdness
- In [Cool-Retro-Term](https://github.com/Swordfish90/cool-retro-term), the coffee icon shows up as a Chinese character. To fix this, simply change the default font to a NerdFont you installed, or change the existing coffee icon to `nf-fa-coffee` from the [NerdFonts cheet sheet](https://www.nerdfonts.com/cheat-sheet).
